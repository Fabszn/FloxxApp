Are you confident that you have complete visibility of all the libraries and dependencies in your application JARs and container images? Can you trust the results of your vulnerability scanner? And how can you verify the integrity of your applications in production?<br>This presentation will show you how to secure the supply chain for your Java applications. We'll cover a range of techniques, patterns, and technologies for secure dependency management, source code integrity, safe builds, vulnerability scanning of Java source code and images, signing and verifying production artifacts, and patching strategies. We'll also explore options for handling supply chain security in a Kubernetes-native way.<br>But this isn't just a theoretical discussion. You'll see a live demonstration of the practices and technologies we'll discuss based on the cutting-edge SLSA framework and the CNCF WG Security research. We'll use open-source tools like Gradle, Sigstore, Cloud Native Buildpacks, Trivy, Syft, and Kyverno.",

Then you go over every new commit with your team, but nothing really stands out. You are unable to reproduce the problem in either regression tests or load tests. This is the kind of situation where you need the flight recorder and mission control. It allows you to capture the nitty gritty details out of your JVM at runtime with a minimal amount of overhead.<br>Given that you run java 8 or later, both flight recorder and mission controls are now open source and free to use, even in production.<br>Unfortunately, at the same time that we got access to the tools, our applications moved into the cloud, running in barebone containers stripped of even the most essential tools, and no longer reachable over the network. So a lot of our toolbox just went out the window!<br>Fear not, we will connect the dots between the JDK tools and JVMs running in the cloud, using only open source tools and standards such as kubernetes and spring boot to achieve this.<br>The presentation is based on live demonstration.",
